  <h1>My Poems</h1>

  <h2 id="while-the-stars-remain">While the Stars Remain</h2>
  <p>
Twenty-three years I’ve been here
A blink, a breath
And the stars have not changed

They wait, indifferent
Scattered across the same vast sky
As if time were something that only belonged
To me

In ten thousand years, they will still shine
Unmoved by the lives that rise and fall
Beneath them

Some will burn out, fading into silence
Some will explode, sending echoes through the universe
Their light chasing a future that may never arrive

I will be long gone before they change
My years vanishing like a ship in the night
And maybe in ten thousand years,
There will be no eyes left to look up
No one left to call them stars

Humanity—a brief streak of motion
There, then not
While the stars remain

  </p>

  <h2 id="my-stellar-birthplace">My Stellar Birthplace</h2>
  <p>
When I was a little girl,  
I used to imagine myself flying through a nebula—  
floating through the cosmos  
with the elements that made mankind.  

I’d close my eyes  
and drift.  

Colors would rise around me—  
lavender, rust, rose-gold,  
folding like wings,  
or arms.  

I didn’t need to steer.  
The stars knew where I was going.  

Dust spun slow as thought,  
and light touched my skin  
like it remembered me.  

There was no noise—  
only warmth,  
and the steady rhythm  
of being part of something vast  
and very old.  

I never called it love.  
But it was close.  

And now,  
every time a new image appears—  
bright and distant  
on a screen or in my hands—  
something inside me lifts:  

quiet,  
stardust-small,  
and weightless  
once more.
  </p>

  <h2 id="a-flicker-of-you">A Flicker of You</h2>
  <p>
You were the northern lights--
Rare, 
Silent, 
And impossible to forget 

Not always there,
But when you were,
The world stood still
Sky cracked open in color
And for a moment,
Everything felt
Brighter

I didn’t always know how to name you--
Just that your laugh 
Lingered like the shimmer, 
And your stories
Danced slow through the dark

Now you’re just out of reach
Just past the edge of where I can follow

But sometimes
When the night is quiet
Andd the air hums with memory,
I feel you again--
A flicker in my chest,
A warmth that doesn’t fade

The northern lights don’t last forever
But once you’ve seen them,
They're always yours

  </p>

  <h2 id="eulogy-in-stardust">Eulogy in Stardust</h2>
  <p>
I find peace in knowing 
That when I die
My body will be transformed

The first law of Thermodynamics states,
“Energy cannot be created or destroyed,
Only converted from one form to another”

When I die
That stuff that I’m made of 
Will be transformed
But never forgotten
Never lost to the whims of the universe

You will find me in everything
The grass
The trees
The breeze you feel 
On a cold winter morning

And when the Sun inevitably
Swallows the Earth whole,
My body will be made
Of everything that has been
Or ever will be

I find peace in knowing
That when I die
My body will be transformed
